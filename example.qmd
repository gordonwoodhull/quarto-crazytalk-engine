## Famous Quotes Reimagined

> "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe."
>
> -- Albert Einstein

Sometimes the most profound wisdom needs to be expressed in a way that reflects the absurdity of existence.

> "In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on."
>
> -- Robert Frost

When rendered through the cRaZyTaLk engine, even the simplest truth becomes a work of visual dissonance, highlighting the chaotic nature of our perceptions.

## How cRaZyTaLk Works

The cRaZyTaLk engine applies a simple but effective transformation:

```typescript
const crazify = (s: string) => {
  let i = 0;
  return s.replace(
    /[a-z]/gi,
    (c) => ++i % 2 ? c.toLowerCase() : c.toUpperCase(),
  );
};
```

This alternating case style was popularized in internet meme culture as a way to express sarcasm or mockery, but here we use it to give profound quotes an air of chaotic wisdom.
